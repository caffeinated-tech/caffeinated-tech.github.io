    I work for the video game studio <a href="http://9thimpact.com/">9th Impact</a> as Lead Server developer. We make games from TV shows for iOS, Android and the Nintendo Switch. My role is as an all round developer, with main responsibility of server development, deployment and administration. My server stack focuses on AWS, Kubernetes, NodeJS and DocumentDB.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our core project is the <a href="https://www.bigbrother.game/">Big Brother Game</a>. This is a seasonal competition, so you won't always find it on the App stores. It has been a great challenge and experience to build the server infrastructure facilitating the world wide multiplayer experience for Big Brother fans. I do plan on writing up the more interesting and esoteric aspects of this long running project eventually. If you want to find out more, I recommend <span id="contact"><a href="/contact">pestering</a></span> me to stop procrastinating and to get writing.

    9th Impact makes various games for iOS, Android and Nintendo Switch. We focus on games based on TV shows, but also branch out from time to time.
    You can check out our games on their various stores (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ie/developer/9th-impact/id948400890?mt=8">App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=9th+Impact"> Play Store</a>)

    Previously I worked at <a href="http://onepagecrm.com" target="_blank">OnePageCRM</a> as a full stack developer. I worked on a CRM SaaS product in Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, Cucumber, SASS, Coffeescript, jQuery and React.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is also where I had my first internship in software development during the summer of 2013. I dove head first into web development and Ruby on Rails. Later I got to spearhead the switch from jQuery to React 0.12. I learnt the ins-and-outs of SaaS, administration and good API design while creating integrations with many other productivity and business services.

  <p>
    I would like to say I do a lot of coding outside of work, but the reality of work-life balance, especially during and post Covid lockdown has dampened that spirit. I still dable, though mostly in work related technologies to stay on top of the rapid trajectory of web development.

  <p>
    Have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/caffeinated-tech/">Github</a> profile for examples. I've created and maintained the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-fast-pagination">mongoose-fast-pagination</a> npm package as my foray into open source software and giving back to the community.

    Community

  <p>
    I used to be a lot more active, and endeavour to get involved again soon. But over the last five years family and personal circumstances have kept me busy. I used to help run the local hackerspace <a href="https://www.facebook.com/091labs/" target="_blank">091 labs</a>. 091 labs is a small community centered group open to everyone interested in learning electronics, software, hardware and networking. We helped out with the excellent <a href="https://www.insight-centre.org/content/computer-communications-museum-ireland">Computer and Communications Museum</a> in the <a href="https://www.insight-centre.org/">Insight center</a> in Galway. If you find yourself in the area, this is definitely worth checking out. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I was involved with various tech meetups in Galway, such as the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rubyreact/" target="_blank"> web developer </a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/web3galway/"> Founders Friday (now Web3) </a> meetup groups. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If you know any similar events or groups in Ireland, please
    <a href="v/contact">get in touch</a>. I'd love to hear about it and would be happy to attend or even give a talk.
