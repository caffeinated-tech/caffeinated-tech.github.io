    I work for the video game studio <a href="http://9thimpact.com/">9th Impact</a> as a developer/dev-ops/sys admin. We make games from TV shows for iOS, Android and the Nintendo Switch. My role is as an all round developer, with main responsibility of server development, deployment and administration. My server stack focuses on Ubuntu, NGinx, NodeJS, MongoDB and Redis, while I'm also brushing up on Unity 3D development and iOS / Android / Nintendo Switch deployment.

    9th Impact makes various games for iOS, Android and Nintendo Switch. We focus on games based on TV shows, but also branch out from time to time.
    You can check out our games on their various stores (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ie/developer/9th-impact/id948400890?mt=8">App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=9th+Impact"> Play Store</a>)
